# ComBatSuite
## Introduction
ComBatSuite is built upon the original sva package found on Bioconductor.
ComBatSuite expands the ComBat tools available to various data sets other than
sequencing data (including methylation data, single cell data, and microbiome
data). 

The `ComBatSuite` package contains functions for removing batch effects and
other unwanted variation in high-throughput experiments. Specifically, the 
`ComBatSuite` package contains functions for identifying and building surrogate 
variables for high-dimensional data sets. Surrogate variables are covariates
constructed directly from high-dimensional data (like gene expression/RNA
sequencing/methylation/brain imaging data) that can be used in subsequent
analyses to adjust for unknown, unmodeled, or latent sources of noise. 

The `ComBatSuite` package can be used to remove artifacts in two ways:

1. Identifying and estimating surrogate variables for unknown sources of 
variation in high-throughput experiments
2. directly removing known batch effects using ComBat [@johnson:2007aa] and its
various versions. 

## Installation
### Github Version
To install the most up-to-date version of ComBatSuite, please install directly
from github. You will need the devtools package. You can install both of these
with the following commands:

``` r
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("devtools")   
}
library(devtools)
install_github("wejlab/ComBatSuite")
```

## Citation
The ComBatSuite package includes multiple different methods created by different
faculty and students, including the original sva package. It would really help
them out if you would cite their work when you use this software.
